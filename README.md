Wizard is a passion project of mine that I'm working on to further hone my programming skills. This project is an action roleplaying game featuring the slaying of a variety of monsters, a host of spells that evolve as the player wizard gains in power, classic roleplaying game leveling and statistics, dungeon exploration, and much more.
